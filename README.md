# Tasks_jr
Tasks Jr. is a basic but powerful web-based task manager/to-do list. This is the work of Alex King who passed away om 2015 and left this wonderful small piece of software to the community.

This tool is based on PHP and MySQL, but as the years passed, these frameworks have been deprecating some functions and introducing some breaking changes. This repository tries to deal with these changes and make this application work again.
Please take in consideration I'm not a web developer and some of the fixes may not be the best solution for the problem it tries to fix. Feel free to drop a comment and create a pull request in that case.

The purpose of this work is to prevent this fantastic program from stop working due to changes introduced in the frameworks on which it is based, so that it does not fall into oblivion.

This is the description found on the [personal web page from Alex King](https://alexking.org/projects/tasks-jr) :

"Tasks Jr. is a basic but powerful web-based task manager/to-do list. I started building it years ago so Iâ€™d have a way to keep track of my own tasks and access them from a Windows box at work, a Mac at home, and a Treo on the go."


This has been tested successfully on Uniform Server Zero XV using PHP 8.3 and MySQL Ver 8.2.0
